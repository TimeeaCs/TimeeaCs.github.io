                    <h3>
                        Physical activities
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Regular physical activity, fitness, and exercise are critically 
                        important for the health and well being of people of all ages. 
                        Research has demonstrated that virtually all individuals can benefit 
                        from regular physical activity, whether they participate in vigorous 
                        exercise or some type of moderate health-enhancing physical activity. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regular physical activity provides a range of physical and mental health, and social benefits, 
                        many of which are increasing issues for individuals, communities and society. 
                        These include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            reducing the risk of many long-term conditions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            helping manage existing conditions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            reduces the risk of dying prematurely from heart disease and other conditions

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            helps build and maintain healthy bones, muscles, and joints
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            developing and maintaining physical and mental function and independence
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            helping maintain a healthy weight
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            reduces feelings of depression and anxiety
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>
                        Strengthening activity
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Muscle strength, bone health and the ability to balance underpin physical function. Each attribute contributes 
                        independently to overall health and functional ability, and in combination they 
                        provide lifelong benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The guidelines also highlight the additional benefit of balance and flexibility exercises 
                        for older adults. Exercises that improve leg strength, balance and coordination can 
                        help people maintain and improve muscle strength and avoid falls as they age. 
                        Improving flexibility can improve posture, reduce aches and pains, lower risk of injury, 
                        and help with continuing to carry out everyday tasks.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Cardiovascular activity
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        For cardiovascular activity, the guidelines state that: each week, adults should accumulate: 
                        at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity (such as brisk walking or cycling), or
                        75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity (such as running), or even shorter durations of 
                        very vigorous intensity activity (such as sprinting or stair climbing), or a combination of moderate, 
                        vigorous and very vigorous intensity activity.
                        <br> 
                        Individuals with uncontrolled symptoms for cardiac, metabolic, renal and some musculoskeletal conditions should 
                        seek advice before greatly increasing physical activity.
